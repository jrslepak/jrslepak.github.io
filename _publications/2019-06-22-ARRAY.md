summary: |
  <a href="/talks/#google2018">Visiting the TensorFlow team at Google</a>
  brought up the question of how
  array programming with Remora differs from
  array programming with Numpy and Pandas.
  Pandas-style data frames,
  a popular tool in data science,
  can be expressed in a rank-polymorphic language
  as arrays of conventional record data.
  Since records were not part of the original design for Remora,
  this paper explores the design space
  to see how best to enable programming with data frames
  in a future extension of Remora.
