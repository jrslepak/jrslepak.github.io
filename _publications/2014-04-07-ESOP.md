summary: |
  This is the beginning of the Remora project,
  presenting the semantics of rank polymorphism
  embedded in a Î»-calculus setting.
  The mathematical formalism was developed alongside
  an executable model in PLT Redex,
  which is linked above.
  Later work includes cleaned-up notation
  and the introduction of a kind system to
  clarify certain restrictions on type quantification.
