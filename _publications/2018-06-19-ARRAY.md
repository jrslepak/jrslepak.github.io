summary: |
  Working on type inference for Remora hit a particular snag:
  when the compiler sees use of a shape-polymorphic function,
  it needs to be able to identify the implicit shape arguments
  to instantiate the polymorphic function correctly.
  While the full theory of shapes (that is, sequences of numbers)
  is undecidable,
  this paper explains how the structure of Remora
  makes it possible for constraint generation to
  stay within a fragment of the theory where
  the universal quantifiers can be eliminated.
