summary: |
  The TensorFlow team at Google invited me to give a talk on
  Remora's programming model, type system, and open problems.
  A preliminary visit earlier in the week
  had brought up data frame computation,
  so this is the first exploration of
  adding heterogeneous records to Remora
  as a way to work with data frames.
  While the thesis proposal is currently
  the most thorough overview of the Remora project,
  the REPL-session style used in much of this talk
  is probably easier to understand without the speaker.
