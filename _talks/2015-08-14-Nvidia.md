summary: |
  Part 2 of a 2-part series
  based on the ESOP 2014 talk,
  describing the design of Remora to the team
  while interning at Nvidia.
#  In contrast to earlier talks,
#  this audience is not already familiar with dependent types,
#  so a fair amount of time is spent on
#  explaining dependent types in general
#  and the restricted form used by Dependent ML and Remora.
