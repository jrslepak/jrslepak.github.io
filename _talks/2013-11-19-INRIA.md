summary: |
  This was an early "project status report"
  while visiting INRIA Rocquencourt
  during my advisor's sabbatical there.
  Since I had a fairly long time slot to fill,
  this includes a lot of worked-out examples
  of evaluating rank-polymorphic code as well as
  a tour of the formal reduction rules
  and some typing rules.
