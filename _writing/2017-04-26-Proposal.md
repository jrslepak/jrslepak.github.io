summary: |
  My thesis proposal lays out both the work done so far
  and a plan for near-future work.
  At this point in time,
  I had dynamic semantics,
  a type system with a soundness proof,
  a sketch of a local type inference algorithm,
  and a type-directed process for translating to a
  language with explicit iteration.
  So the remaining research problems necessary to
  bring Remora into a fully working state
  are a constraint solver for array shapes,
  a more general term calculus,
  and optimizations to cut down on
  materializing large arrays.
